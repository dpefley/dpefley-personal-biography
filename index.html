    <h3>Wikipedia Bio:</h3>
    <p>
      Posey was born in Leesburg, Georgia. He played four sports in high school; when playing baseball, he excelled at hitting and pitching. He attended Florida State University, where he began playing the catcher and first base positions. He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called back up to the major leagues in May. With the presence of then full-time catcher Bengie Molina, Posey played first base when originally called up to the majors, but became the Giants' regular catcher at the end of June when Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers, the team the Giants later faced in the World Series.

      As a rookie, he finished with a .305 batting average, 18 home runs, and 67 runs batted in. He was named the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year. He caught every inning of the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. In 2011, Posey missed most of the year after he was severely injured in a collision with Scott Cousins at home plate.

      Posey returned from his injury in 2012 and posted a .336 batting average to win the 2012 NL batting title. He became the second San Francisco Giant to win the batting title and was named the NL Most Valuable Player for 2012. He won his second World Series that year as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers in four games. In 2013, Posey signed a franchise record eight-year, $167 million contract extension with the Giants.[2] He won his third World Series the following year as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals. In 2016, he won his first Gold Glove award after an excellent defensive season.
